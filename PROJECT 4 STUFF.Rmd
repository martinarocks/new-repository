## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



 # Now, I will write a function that does something! 
 

```{r}
awesomecode <- c("i", "love", "r", "so", "so", "much")
asterisk <- "***"

highlight <- function(content, wrapper) {
  answer <- c(wrapper, content, wrapper)
  return(answer)
}
```

```{r}
awesomecode(awesomecode, asterisk)
```
